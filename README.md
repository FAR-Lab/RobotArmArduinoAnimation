# Robot Arm Arduino Animation

### Summary
A six servo robotic hand is controlled in 3D space with the help of an Arduino Mini--more specifically an Adafruit Micro Mini. The code defines a 3D point based system for the robot to move around in, and has functions that help calculate movements to points in space. The user inputs points the robot would like to move to and the code calculates the required angles each servo must move to in order to reach that point.

### Robot Specs + Assembly + Schematic
The name of the particular robot arm I used to build and test on was called the **LewanSoul 6DOF**.

### Desmos Graphing Tool
Desmos was an important tool in defining the necessary functions to allow the robot to move correctly.

### 3D Graphing Calculator Software
Runiter was used to create 3D paths, as well as create a solid visualization for the possible range of the robot.
